# ✨ Hyprland SCSS Tweaks

A personal collection of SCSS modifications built on top of [end-4's Hyprland dotfiles](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland), aiming to bring a fresh, aesthetic, and dynamic touch to the Hyprland experience.

## 🎯 Overview

This repo contains custom SCSS tweaks that modify various UI components like:
- **Bars (AGS)**
- **App Launchers**
- **Popups & Widgets**
- **Colors, Borders & Animations**

All styles are optimized for a minimal, clean, and modern Wayland environment while staying faithful to end-4's original layout philosophy.

## 🛠️ Installation

For now, manually copy and paste all the scss code into all the matching files in `~/.config/ags/scss/`, for some files like notifications.scss and etc, you will have to replace the code instead of adding it.
